# Word Document Automation

## Overview
This project automates the generation of Word documents from Excel data using Python. It processes an Excel file, fills a Word template with relevant data, and updates tables accordingly. Additionally, the project runs a secondary script (`table_update.py`) to refine table data after document generation.

## Features
- Extracts data from an Excel file
- Fills placeholders in a Word template
- Updates only the matched tables with data
- Runs `table_update.py` automatically after generating documents

## Installation
To set up the project, install the required dependencies using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Ensure your input files (`template.docx`, `data.xlsx`) are in the project directory.
2. Run the main script:
```sh
python index.py
```
3. Generated documents will be saved in the `generated_docs` folder.
